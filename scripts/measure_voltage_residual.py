"""Regenerate the residual table in :mod:`sandbox.observation`.

    uv run python scripts/measure_voltage_residual.py

The claim being measured: own bus voltage tracks feeder congestion almost
perfectly, but a household already knows most of it from its own PV, its own
load and the clock. What is left over -- the part genuinely about the
neighbourhood -- is what a controller could actually learn from reading
voltage, and on a stiff feeder it is smaller than a real meter can resolve.

The regression is deliberately the simplest reading of that sentence: per
household, ordinary least squares of own ``voltage_pu`` on own
``pv_available_kw``, own ``p_load_kw`` and the clock (``time_sin``,
``time_cos``), with an intercept. Residuals are pooled across households and
reported as a percentage of nominal voltage, next to the ~0.5 % of nominal a
Class 1 meter resolves.

This script exists because the numbers it produces are quoted in
``sandbox/observation.py``, ``sandbox/scenarios.py``, the README and
``CONTROLLER_COOKBOOK.md``, and they went stale once before: the figures
predating the persistent-weather change were roughly a third narrower than
the model now produces, and two files disagreed about the rural residual for
some time before anyone noticed. Re-run this whenever the weather model, the
population or the feeder set changes, and update those four places together.

It runs the eager rollout path, because a household's own load is a field of
``LocalObservation`` and never reaches ``Trajectory``. That takes a few
minutes for the full table.
