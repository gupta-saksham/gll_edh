"""The other seam you edit: the grid tariff.

A tariff settles one interval and returns what every connection point owes or
earns, in CHF. It runs **after** the interval, with the realized power flow in
front of it -- every bus voltage, every flow, the transformer's throughput.
That is the whole asymmetry this challenge rests on:

============ ============================================ ==================
seam         sees                                         runs
============ ============================================ ==================
tariff       everything: the solved network               after the interval
controller   one household's own meter                    before, blind
============ ============================================ ==================

What is being settled is ``e_grid_kwh``: the net energy exchanged with the
grid at each connection point, inverter output minus household load. Not the
inverter's output, and not the household's consumption -- the meter reading.
A household chooses its inverter setpoint; it is billed on what that came to
after its own load was served. See :mod:`sandbox.observation`.

Retroactive means **unknowable when the household acted**, not dependent on
the future. A price computed from the power flow that just solved is fully
retroactive in the sense that matters -- nobody could have reacted to it --
and it is perfectly causal, which is why nothing here needs to see forward in
time. See ``docs/lookahead_rewards.md`` in `gll_env` if you ever want a
settlement that genuinely does.

Two rules your tariff has to respect, and one it should
------------------------------------------------------
It must publish a ``(num_pq,)`` settlement, not a ``(num_agents,)`` one. Six
of the eighteen connection points are tenants with no inverter and therefore
no agent; they are absent from the reward array entirely, and they are exactly
the households a badly designed tariff harms.

It must not print money. The jury gates on revenue adequacy, because a tariff
that simply pays everybody produces a delighted population and a bankrupt
network operator. Redistribution passes; subsidy does not.

And it should be worth anticipating. A price nobody can predict is noise, and
households tune against expected structure. If your tariff is unpredictable
even in distribution, no controller can respond to it and you have built a
lottery rather than a mechanism.

    energy, grid usage, public duties -- with one construction on top: trading
    inside a local electricity community waives 40 % of the grid usage fee,
    and fair LEG splits that saving **evenly** between the injector and the
    consumer. Symmetric by construction, hence the name. Every member gains
    the same 1.19 Rp./kWh off-peak and 2.38 Rp./kWh peak against its own
    fallback rate.

    Why not ewz's actual LEG product? That is **Solarquartier**, and it is
    also bundled in `gll_env` (``payments: solarquartier``). It grants the
    consumer the full 40 % rebate but charges a flat 13 Rp./kWh LEG energy
    rate, which is well above what ewz.natur charges off-peak -- so a pure
    consumer inside a Solarquartier LEG pays about 5.7 Rp./kWh **more**
    off-peak than it would outside, and saves only about 1.1 Rp./kWh at peak.
    The producer captures nearly all of the community's saving. As a baseline
    that is too easy to beat and too easy to beat for the wrong reason: any
    tariff that stops actively penalising consumers looks like a triumph.

    So the status quo modelled here is deliberately the *fair* version --
    a LEG whose incentives are already balanced between the two sides. Beating

    Out of the box it settles energy exactly as fair LEG does, then adds a
    congestion term driven by the feeder's own aggregate flow. When the whole
    feeder pushes past ``headroom_kwh`` in either direction, the households
    pushing it in that direction are charged in proportion to how much of the
    excess is theirs, and the proceeds are rebated equally across all
    eighteen connection points.

    "Fair LEG plus a surcharge" is one shape among many, chosen here because
    it is short. :meth:`settlement_from_view` returns the whole interval's
    settlement; override it (or hand a plain function to
    :func:`tariff_from_settlement`) to price the interval however you like,
    fair LEG included or not. See ``TARIFF_COOKBOOK.md``.

    Three properties worth keeping if you build on the default rather than
    replacing it outright:

    * **Retroactive.** It is computed from the flow that just happened, so no
      household knew it while acting.
    * **Revenue neutral.** The charge is redistributed rather than collected,
      so it passes the adequacy gate by construction. Break this and your
      tariff is a subsidy or a tax, not a price.
    * **Locational, at least in principle.** It charges contribution to a
      shared problem rather than consumption as such.

    The defaults are set where the mechanism visibly bites: at 1.00 CHF/kWh
    above 3 kWh the tuned household caps its exports, and much below that it
    does not. Worth knowing why the number is so much larger than the
    0.14 CHF/kWh feed-in rate it competes with -- the charge is shared pro
    rata, so one household's *marginal* exposure is only its share of it, an
    order of magnitude less than the headline. A price that looks punitive at
    the top can be nearly invisible at the margin, which is the first thing
    to check when a tariff seems to do nothing.

    **And it bites the wrong way, which is the interesting part.** Run
    ``score()`` on the shipped defaults and the export peak nearly halves and
    the ramp improves -- because the household's cheapest response to the
    charge is to cap exports and *throw generation away*. Curtailment goes
    from under 2 % of what the roofs could make to over a quarter of it, and
    the community's settlement halves with it. A tariff that flattens the
    feeder by spilling solar has not solved anything; it has bought one
    metric with another, which is why ``curtailed_share`` and
    ``community_settlement_chf`` are in the jury.

    The second flaw is structural. It is an *aggregate* signal: every
    household on the feeder sees the same congestion condition, so every
    household tuned against it responds in the same interval. It prices the
    symptom rather than the location, and a population optimising against it
    may well synchronise harder, not less -- watch ``coincidence_factor``.
    The voltage and impedance data needed for a genuinely nodal price are all
    in `new_state`.

    Args:
        prosumer: The environment's prosumer dynamics, for the LEG settlement
            underneath and for ``num_pq``.
        headroom_kwh: Aggregate feeder flow, per interval and in either
            direction, that costs nothing. Beyond it, congestion is priced.
            Only used by :func:`default_tariff` and by a direct
            ``MyTariff(...)``; a participant's own numbers come from
            ``TARIFF_PARAMS`` through
            :func:`tariff_from_settlement` instead, and these two arguments
            are then ignored.
        price_chf_per_kwh: What a kWh of excess flow costs the household
            responsible for it. Same caveat.
        init_carry: Builds the tariff's starting carry -- state that survives
            across intervals. Defaults to `init_tariff_memory`; supply your
            own the way a controller supplies its own `init_carry`.
