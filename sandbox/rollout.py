"""The loop. Infrastructure -- you should not need to edit this file.

Two things it guarantees, and both matter:

**The controller never sees a price.** It is handed a
:class:`~sandbox.observation.LocalObservation` and its own carry, and nothing
else. ``timestep.reward`` is the settlement for the interval that just
ended -- routing it to the controller would collapse a settlement lag of days
into one interval and delete the premise of the challenge.

**The controller never sees a neighbour.** It is ``jax.vmap``'d per household,
so there is no agent axis inside it to index.

Two speeds, same semantics:

* ``fast=True`` -- ``lax.scan`` over a jitted step, ``vmap`` over households.
* ``fast=False`` -- a Python loop, and a list comprehension instead of vmap.
  Around 100x slower per interval, and worth every bit of it while you are
  writing a controller: values are concrete, so ``if`` works, ``print``
  works, and a traceback points at your line instead of at a tracer.

Write it eager, score it fast. The results are identical, and
``tests/test_scenarios.py`` asserts it.

    Attributes:
        p_inv_set_kw: (T, num_agents) The inverter setpoint each controller
            asked for.
        p_inv_realized_kw: (T, num_agents) What it actually got, after the
            environment's feasibility projection. The gap between this and
            ``p_inv_set_kw`` is how much a controller is asking for and not
            receiving.
        e_grid_kwh: (T, num_pq) Net energy exchanged with the grid at every
            connection point -- inverter output minus household load, tenants
            included. This, not ``p_inv_*``, is what a tariff settles.
        reward_chf: (T, num_agents) Per-agent settlement, aligned with the
            interval it describes.
        settlement_chf: (T, num_pq) The same settlement over *all* connection
            points. Tenants have no agent and are absent from ``reward_chf``
            entirely, so this is what any fairness question must read.
        pv_available_kw: (T, num_agents) What each roof could have produced.
        pv_realized_kw: (T, num_agents) What it was allowed to. The difference
            is curtailment -- generation thrown away because the inverter had
            nowhere to put it. Under a Q(U) grid code this, rather than
            over-voltage, is usually what binds: the code holds voltage by
            absorbing reactive power and, past that, by curtailing.
        q_grid_kvarh: (T, num_pq) Reactive energy at each connection point.
            Mostly the grid code's doing, and a real cost to the network.
        transformer_kw: (T,) Active power through the substation transformer,
            positive when the feeder draws from the grid and negative when it
            exports. The quantity that decides whether a transformer must be
            replaced -- and the one constraint a meshed urban network cannot
            mesh its way out of, since meshing buys voltage stiffness and no
            thermal capacity at all.
        transformer_kvar: (T,) Reactive power through it.
        losses_kw: (T,) Network losses. Quadratic in flow, so synchronised
            behaviour costs more than its average suggests.
        voltage_pu: (T, num_bus) Voltage magnitude everywhere.
        day_step: (T,) Interval within the day, for time-of-day breakdowns.
        valid: (T,) Whether the power flow converged.
