"""The reference scenario: who lives on the feeder, and where.

`gll_env`'s own default gives all eighteen connection points an identical
prosumer. That is the right default for a zero-config environment, and the
wrong population for this challenge, on three counts:

* **Fairness has nothing to measure.** With identical households the Gini is
  zero by construction and any spread is noise from the load process.
* **Herding becomes dismissible.** Clones running one controller synchronize
  perfectly -- "well, obviously" -- while hiding the finding actually worth
  having, that a *heterogeneous* population still synchronizes.
* **Nodal pricing has nothing to price.** With identical injections everywhere,
  nodal prices separate only by line impedance.

So: four household types, placed by electrical distance from the transformer.

Sizing target
-------------
Naive control must **stress the network**, and a better controller must be
able to do something about it. Both are calibration targets to verify, not
assumptions -- see ``tests/test_scenarios.py``.

"Stress" is not only over-voltage. On the ``rural`` feeder this challenge
runs on, voltage does cross the planning trigger -- about 8.7 % of
bus-intervals sit above 1.05 pu and the week peaks at 1.107, right at the
EN 50160 limit. But the constraints that bind everywhere, ``urban``
included, are the ones the jury weights most: reverse flow through a
transformer specified for one direction (42 % of the week), the loss of the
diversity network planning depends on, and the ramp. See
:mod:`sandbox.metrics`.

Two ways to mis-size, and the second is less obvious:

* Too small, and nothing moves. Every tariff scores identically.
* PV too *large*, and the batteries saturate before noon. Control then has no
  authority at all: the naive and do-nothing baselines converge, because the
  peak becomes "generation minus load" whatever anyone does. Measured: at
  twice the reference PV, the naive controller is no better than doing
  nothing. This is a real property of a fully-solarized quarter.

The reference sits between them at 9-15 kWp -- typical of a Swiss install
today, since roofs are filled rather than matched to consumption -- against
storage of 13-20 kWh and inverters rated at roughly 0.8 of the array.

Two things measured and deliberately NOT done: bigger batteries (13 to 19 kWh
moved control authority by 0.1 pp, because the binding ratio is surplus to
storage and 50 % more storage does not close it), and rearranging who sits
where on the feeder (three layouts gave the same voltage statistics to within
0.2 pp, and voltage is already only 33 % explained by distance).

#: is not an urban phenomenon, though: it bites on longer runs of thinner
#: conductor serving detached houses with large roofs and low coincident load.
#: So the LV branch impedances are scaled to reach a feeder where it does.
#:
#: ``urban``     1.0x -- 0.135 ohm, the bundled asset untouched.
#: ``suburban``  3.5x -- 0.459 ohm, the magnitude of IEC 60725's reference LV
#:                       network impedance (0.4 + j0.25 ohm).
#: ``rural``     7.0x -- 0.912 ohm, roughly twice IEC 60725. A long feeder
#:                       where a single 5 kW injection moves local voltage by
#:                       around 3 %.
#:
#: **The hackathon runs on ``rural`` and that is not a setting to change.**
#: Every submission is scored on it; :data:`FEEDER_IMPEDANCE_SCALE` below
#: says why. The other two are kept because the comparison is instructive

    "suburban": 3.5,
    "rural": 7.0,
}

#: The feeder every submission is scored on. **Fixed for the hackathon.**
#:
#: The reason is the household seam. On ``urban`` a household has essentially
#: nothing local to read: own bus voltage correlates with congestion at
#: +0.99, but about 86 % of it is already implied by that household's own PV,
#: own load and the clock, leaving a residual of 0.25 % of nominal -- below
#: the ~0.5 % a Class 1 meter resolves. A controller "reading voltage"
#: there is reading a noisy clock, and the controller pathway would be a
#: dead end by construction.
#:
#: ``rural`` lifts that residual to 1.01 %, twice meter resolution, and takes
#: over-voltage from never to about 8.7 % of bus-intervals. Turning the grid
#: code off instead of weakening the feeder was measured and does almost
#: nothing: Q(U) only acts outside its deadband, and on a stiff feeder
#: voltage never gets there.
#:
#: What does *not* change with the feeder is the rest of the pathology.
#: Reverse flow sits at 42 % of the week and the coincidence factor at 0.79
#: on all three -- diversity is purely behavioural, so the herding this
#: challenge is about is the same problem on ewz's own meshed network as on
#: a long rural line. Only the export peak and the voltage move
#: (68 kW / 1.107 pu rural, 81 kW / 1.023 pu urban).
#:
#: The residuals come from ``scripts/measure_voltage_residual.py``; re-run it
#: rather than editing them here, and update the table in
#: :mod:`sandbox.observation` in the same breath.
FEEDER_IMPEDANCE_SCALE = FEEDER_STRENGTHS["rural"]

#: Weather that persists for days rather than jittering hourly. The two are a
#: pair and neither means anything alone -- see the note at the bottom of this
#: module. Together they give roughly three times the week-to-week variation of
#: gll_env's defaults at the same intra-day character, and they make the
#: herding demo markedly sharper.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# On weather: clearness_reversion and clearness_std only mean anything together
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# An Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process has stationary spread ``std / sqrt(2 * rev)``
# and correlation time ``1 / rev``. Those share both parameters, which is why
# sweeping either one alone is misleading -- and it misled this file once.
#
# Vary std alone and nothing happens: at gll_env's default reversion of 0.05
# the process reverts within about five hours, so a week is an average over
# ~130 independent spells and the day-to-day noise cancels out of the weekly
# total. Tripling std moves the week-to-week spread DOWN, because larger steps
# just clip harder against clearness's [0, 1] bounds.
#
# Vary reversion alone and the amplitude explodes: at std 0.10 dropping
# reversion to 0.005 puts the stationary spread at 1.0, so clearness spends its
# time pinned at the bounds and saturation eats the extra variation.
#
# Move them together, holding the spread fixed, and the effect appears --
# variation migrates out of intra-day jitter and into between-week persistence:
#
#     rev     std    spread  corr.time   week CV   day CV
#     0.050   0.100   0.32       5 h       3.6 %    8.2 %   <- gll_env default
#     0.020   0.040   0.20      12 h       4.0 %    6.9 %
#     0.005   0.020   0.20      50 h       6.3 %    5.8 %
#     0.001   0.009   0.20     250 h       8.5 %    3.4 %
#     0.001   0.018   0.40     250 h      11.7 %    6.4 %   <- used here
#
# The setting used here gives about three times the default's week-to-week
# variation while keeping day-to-day variation realistic. Two things it buys,
# both measured:
#
# It makes the challenge SHARPER rather than noisier. The ramp pathology --
# self-consumption's steepest transformer swing against doing nothing -- goes
# from 1.57x to 2.72x, because sustained sunny spells let every battery fill
# and then stop absorbing together, where jittery weather staggered the fills
# and masked the effect.
#
# And the leaderboard survives it. Every pairwise comparison between reference
# controllers is still distinguishable at 95 % confidence over twenty seeds,
# because the comparisons are PAIRED on the same weather -- common variation
# cancels, and only the controller difference is left.
#
# What is still missing is seasonality. clearness_mean is pinned at 0.6 with no
# solar declination, so an episode can be a duller week but never a winter one,
# and 11.7 % is still short of the 30-50 % real Swiss weeks vary by. The
# remaining fix is not in this file: clearness_mean would have to be drawn per
# episode in gll_env, which is a fixed field of the dynamics today rather than
# something reset() samples.
