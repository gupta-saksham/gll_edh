"""How a tariff actually reaches a household: by being tuned against.

No household sees a price during an episode -- real settlement lags past the
end of one. So a tariff changes nothing about behaviour on its own, and
scoring a submitted tariff against a *fixed* controller measures redistribution
and nothing else: identical peaks, identical ramps, identical everything
physical. Verified, not assumed; it is what the harness does if you skip this
step.

What a tariff does is change what a household would *want* to have done, which
shows up when the household re-tunes. So the tariff pathway is scored by
re-tuning the base controller against the submitted tariff first. That makes
the evaluation a Stackelberg game -- the network operator moves, households
best-respond -- which is the correct frame for mechanism design and also the
only one in which a tariff can be said to have worked.

Two rules
---------
**The tuner maximises the household's own bill, never the grid score.** A tuner
that optimises network welfare assumes benevolent households and measures what
a central planner could achieve rather than what a price can induce. The gap
between what a household wants and what the network needs *is* the mechanism
design problem; closing it is what designing a tariff means.

**Parameters are shared across the population.** Heterogeneity lives in the
state -- a tenant has ``p_inv_min_kw == p_inv_max_kw == 0``, so the same parameters
produce no action from them -- which keeps this one optimisation rather than a
twelve-player game with a fixed point to chase.
