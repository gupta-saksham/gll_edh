"""The jury. Fixed, and not editable by participants.

What a distribution network operator actually worries about, which is mostly
**not voltage**. Over-voltage is real on the ``rural`` feeder this challenge
runs on -- 8.7 % of bus-intervals above 1.05 pu, peaking at 1.107 -- and it
is reported (the ``>1.05`` column). But on the dense meshed network ewz
actually operates, meshing buys voltage stiffness and no thermal capacity
whatsoever, so voltage sits comfortably in band while the transformer, the
cables and the planning assumptions take the strain. The jury is weighted
for the constraints that bind on both: reverse flow, lost diversity, ramp.

Five families, and the third and fourth are the ones this challenge turns on.

**Network.** Transformer peak in both directions, how much of the week runs in
reverse, and losses. Reverse flow matters on its own: urban transformers,
their protection settings and their thermal models were largely specified for
power flowing one way.

**Economics.** What the community paid, against a do-nothing floor, plus what
was thrown away. Curtailed generation is real money, and a tariff that buys a
flat feeder by spilling a fifth of the solar has not solved anything.

**Diversity.** The coincidence factor -- peak of the sum over sum of the
peaks -- is the DSO's own planning quantity, the thing that lets a network be
built for far less than the sum of its connections. Synchronised control
destroys it, and destroying it invalidates the assumption the network was
sized under. It is also purely behavioural: identical at every feeder
impedance, so it measures the mechanism rather than the wiring.

**Ramp.** The steepest interval-to-interval swing at the transformer. This is
where herding shows up first and most violently, and where a controller that
looks good on every household metric can be twice as bad as doing nothing.

**Fairness.** What each household paid per kWh it consumed, and how far apart
the best and worst treated are. Computed over all connection points, never
just the agents: households without an inverter are absent from the reward
array entirely, and they are exactly the ones a badly designed tariff harms.
