"""Get the whole run out as a table, and stop needing JAX.

The fairness and visualisation pathways do not require anybody to learn this
codebase. Run one rollout, call :func:`to_dataframe`, and the rest is pandas,
Observable, R, or a spreadsheet.

Two frames, because the run has two natural grains:

* :func:`to_dataframe` -- one row per interval per connection point. Long
  format, so a group-by answers most questions in one line.
* :func:`feeder_dataframe` -- one row per interval, for the network as a whole.

The connection frame carries **all eighteen** points, tenants included. That
matters more than it sounds: six households have no inverter and therefore no
agent, so they are missing entirely from anything indexed by agent -- and they
are precisely the households a fairness audit exists to ask about.
