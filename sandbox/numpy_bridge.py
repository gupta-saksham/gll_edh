"""Write your controller -- or your tariff -- in plain NumPy.

There is no shim that makes arbitrary NumPy run under ``vmap`` and ``jit``.
`jax.numpy` is already almost API-compatible with NumPy; what breaks is
control flow, mutation and side effects -- ``if x > 0``, ``arr[i] = v``,
Python loops, ``.item()``. None of that is fixable by an import, and it
applies to a tariff exactly as much as a controller: `my_tariff` is jnp code
under the same ``jit``/``scan``, not a plain Python function that happens to
be called less often.

So instead this runs your function as *actual* NumPy, on the host, from inside
the compiled rollout. You get real ``if``, real loops, real SciPy, and working
``print`` and ``breakpoint`` inside a jitted scan.

::

    @numpy_controller(init_carry=my_carry)
    def my_rule(obs, carry, params):
        if obs["voltage_pu"] > 1.02:          # a real branch
            return 0.0, carry
        return float(obs["p_load_kw"]), carry

    @numpy_tariff
    def my_price(grid, carry, params):
        if grid["hour"] > 18:                 # a real branch, over the feeder
            return -0.20 * grid["e_grid_kwh"], carry
        return -0.10 * grid["e_grid_kwh"], carry

`obs`/`grid` arrive as a dict of plain NumPy values -- ``obs["voltage_pu"]``,
``grid["e_grid_kwh"]`` and so on; see
:meth:`sandbox.observation.LocalObservation.as_dict` and
:meth:`sandbox.observation.GridView.as_dict` for the full sets.

`numpy_tariff` is the simpler of the two: a tariff already runs once per
interval over the whole feeder, not once per household, so there is no agent
axis to fake under ``vmap`` -- it is a bare host round trip, no
``vmap_method`` to reason about.

Three tiers, all interchangeable -- but prefer the JAX one
----------------------------------------------------------
The rollout cannot tell these apart and the results are identical, so a
submission may mix them freely. Only wall clock differs, and it differs by
more than a single rollout suggests:

============ ================================ ========== =========== =========
tier         how                              one week   tune sweep  score()
============ ================================ ========== =========== =========
jax          plain ``jnp``                    2.0 s      17 s        ~2 min
numpy        this module                      6.9 s      128 s       ~20 min
eager        ``rollout(..., fast=False)``     ~100x/step --          --
============ ================================ ========== =========== =========

**Write the finished thing in JAX if you possibly can.** The 3.4x on one
rollout understates the cost: :func:`sandbox.tuning.tune` evaluates every
candidate on every seed as a single nested ``vmap`` -- one compile, the whole
grid at once -- and this tier cannot batch at all, because
``vmap_method="sequential"`` is exactly what makes a NumPy author's scalar
code work. It pays a host round trip per household per interval per
candidate per seed. Prototype here when the JAX form is not obvious, then
port; ``jnp.where`` replaces most ``if``s mechanically.

Two rules survive into this tier
--------------------------------
**The carry must be a fixed-shape, fixed-dtype pytree.** The host callback has
to declare what it returns before it runs, so your carry cannot grow a list or
change dtype between intervals. This is the one JAX rule NumPy does not buy
you out of.

**No side effects.** ``pure_callback`` is pure by contract; a mutated global
may be dropped or reordered. Everything comes back through the carry.

No ``key`` either, for a controller: the callback takes ``(obs, carry,
params)`` only. Seed any randomness you want from ``params`` or the carry.
