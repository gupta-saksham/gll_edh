"""Scoring a submission: four rollouts, not one.

ewz publishes a tariff; it does not choose anybody's controller. Households
do that, in their own interest -- so if the price is any good, the controller
that serves their interest is the one the submission proposes. A submitted
controller is a claim about the follower's best response, not a product to be
installed.

Both cells under a submitted tariff therefore best-respond to it. They differ
in what they may best-respond *with*: the strategy households run today, or
the strategy the submission proposes. A household cannot best-respond into a
strategy its firmware cannot express, which makes the first the short-run
answer and the second the equilibrium the price is steering toward.

The response is bounded by design. :func:`~sandbox.tuning.tune` searches a
declared parameter grid inside the controller of the cell it is scoring --
:data:`~sandbox.controller.TUNING_GRID` for the base controller,
``Submission.candidates`` (``TUNE_OVER``) for a submitted one -- not every
controller anyone could write. An unconstrained follower would be a research
project rather than a scoring step, and would leave the premium nothing to
measure.

Four cells, at the cost of one extra pair of rollouts:

===================== ===================== ==========================
                      today's controller    your controller
===================== ===================== ==========================
**fair LEG**          reference floor       does yours help *today*?
**your tariff**       the short run: the    the equilibrium: your
                      installed base        price at its best response
===================== ===================== ==========================

The gap between the two bottom cells is the **co-design premium**: how much of
the result waits on controllers of the proposed shape existing at all.
Reported, not gated -- it measures how far the market has to move before the
mechanism pays in full, which is a judgement for the jury rather than a
threshold.

Every cell involving a submitted tariff re-tunes its controller first, the
bottom-left one included. That is not a control to be corrected for: the
household's best response *is* the follower move the Stackelberg game is built
on. Without it a tariff changes nothing physical whatsoever, because nobody
can see a price during an episode, and the row would measure redistribution
alone.
