"""Acceptance tests for the reference scenario.

These are not unit tests. They assert that the challenge has *signal*: that
the naive population actually stresses the feeder, and that a controller can
do something about it. Both are properties of a calibration, and a calibration
drifts -- change the population, the feeder, or the grid code, and one of
these will catch it before a leaderboard built on it does.
